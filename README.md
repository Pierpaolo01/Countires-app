## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country using an `input` field
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page
- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JS - Latest features

### What I learned

I learned about some of the more advanced features in JS regarding fetch, promisses, await functionality & Json handeling. 


### Continued development

I really look forward to building more projects where there is a necessity to fetch data from an api, connecting the back-end solutions to the front-end. o
